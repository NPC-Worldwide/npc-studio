# NPC Studio

NPC Studio is an AI IDE that lets users have AI conversations, edit files, explore data, execute code, and much more.

## Installation

### NPM Installation (Recommended)

When installed via the executables or if you manually build npc-studio yourself, then it will be available as
```bash
npc-studio
```
This difference in naming between the two is to avoid naming conflicts for those working on development of NPC Studio who want 
to have a more stable version installed.


When running for the first time, you'll be prompted to install Python dependencies. This will create a virtual environment in your home directory under `.npc_studio/venv` and install the required packages.

### Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher (for the backend)
- Ollama (optional, for local models)

## Chat with Agents and organize by project path
- NPC Studio gives users the capability to organize their conversations with AI agents in a natural and convenient way. Users can easily change working directories and separate their conversations by project path.

- Aggregate conversations:

## Create and manage agents, tools
- NPC Studio uses the `npcsh` agent framework to simplify the building and orchestration of AI agents.

- Additionally, users can create and manage tools to be used by agents.

## Edit plain text files
- NPC Studio is not just a chat interface, users can also edit plain text files (with agent-based integrations soon to come).

### Project Settings

-When working in a specific folder, NPC Studio will discover an `.env` fiel if it's present and will use these API keys to determine which models can be used within the project.

## Activity Dashboard (planned)

- view key activity metrics 

## Knowledge Graph (planned)
- view the knowledge graph built up over time through your actions

## Use mixtures of agents (planned)

## Exploratory data analysis (planned)

## Automate with cron jobs and system daemons (planned)




## Getting Started with Development

NPC studio is electron-based frontend with a python flask backend.


Before getting started with development, ensure that you have the following installed
- [npcsh](https://github.com/cagostino/npcsh)
- node+npm
- ollama (if you plan to rely on local models)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cagostino/npc-studio.git
```

```bash
npm install
```
Start the electron backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Start the flask backend:
```bash
npc serve -p 5337 -c 'localhost:5137' # the -c indicates the url of the frontend so that the server can use CORS
```
Alternatively use the wrapper script that is provided
```bash
python npc_studio_serve.py
```
Start the electron frontend:
```bash
npm start
```


## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
This will build the frontend and backend into a single executable file. In its current state, it specifies a build target for
creating .deb and AppImage files in linux. Other OS to be added in the future.
